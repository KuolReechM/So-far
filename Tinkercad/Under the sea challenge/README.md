Under the Sea Challenge submission (Tinkercad)

Background
This is my first design in 3D modelling usingtinkercad and an attempt to recreate the shape of a submarine potrayed in the image. I anticipated this choice to pose a tough challenge to the little I have picked up thus far.

Design details
A maority of the shapes I used were from the basic shapes category.
I found the shading of the shapes into different shapes challenging and creating the motor from scratch kind of difficult as well.

Feedback request
I would be happy to receive any feedback on the design.
